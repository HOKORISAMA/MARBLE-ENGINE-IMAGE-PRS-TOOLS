#Pack or unpack Marble Engine Resources including script file as well.
1. You can either rebuild the whole script file or create a patch, just name the patch as mg_data2.mbl, mg_data3.mbl and so on.
2. You can extarct the prs images and convert them to png then convert them back to .prs format from the provided tools. You can create a patch for the images as well with mg_gra2.mbl and so on.
3. The script files are in plain text but with some system configuration data (Somewhat like kirikiri). You should be able to edit the files in any text editor but I suggest you to use SExtractor.
4. For the keys you'll need to use GarBro, just locate the script file and open with garbro the prompt will ask you to select the key, just find the key with game name.
